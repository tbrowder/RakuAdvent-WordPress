<!-- title: Day 23 - A Raku Advent Helper -->

<h3>Introduction</h3>
I have been writing Raku Advent posts annually
since 2016 and it's always been a struggle for me
to get a reliable transformation of my source file
into the Raku Advent Wordpress (WP) website without something getting changed
by WP. Then, the menus are terrible and editing can
be troublesome. In this article I hope to show how the situation
can be improved.
<h3>Background</h3>
The great name change to Raku this year unfortunately happened late in the
  year and there was not a lot of time to get a new Raku Advent website
  ready. Consequently, theme selection and tweaking, confusion
  over the actual Raku Advent website link, and unfortunate article
  cancellations were wrinkles in the normally
  smoother process. However, we plan to improve the website before
  the 2020 Advent season, and also get commitments earlier with
  concrete drafts available sooner. In the meantime, in this hastily prepared
  stand-in article, I will go into a bit of detail on some help
we hope to offer.
<h4>Article creation</h4>
In past years I've created the articles in Gihub-flavored
markdown, manually (with the assistance of my Emacs editor)
converted each paragraph to single, long lines, and then posted it in a Github gist
After that, I used the tool, developed by Zoffix and modified by ??,
to extract the html from Github's representation of the
markdown which results in a nice highlighting of code
blocks. Finally, that html is copied and pasted into WP and a publishing
schedule set up. That process is outlined here:
<ol>
<li> Write the post in Github-favored Markdown text</li>
<li> Collapse each paragraph to one long line</li>
<li> Paste the source into a Github gist</li>
<li> Use the existing Advent tool to extract the resulting
   html representation to one's local computer</li>
<li> Copy the html and paste it into the blank, html
   view of the selected WP editor</li>
<li> View the finished product and check for errors</li>
</ol>
If errors are found:
<ol start="7">
<li> Correct the errors in the WP editor</li>
</ol>
OR
<ol start="7">
<li> correct the errors in the source</li>
<li> repeat steps 2 through 6 again</li>
</ol>
That process is not so bad the first time though it, but when, inevitably,
errors are found, one has the choice of manually editing it on WP
or modifying the source and going through the entire process again!
Neither choice is very good. So I created a Raku tool to eliminate
some of the problems. My new steps as of this year:
<ol>
<li> write the post in raw html</li>
<li> run my Advent tool (<em>make-wp-advent</em>) to format the source
   into WP-acceptable html</li>
<li> copy the html and paste it into the blank, html
   view of the selected WP editor</li>
<li> view the finished product and check for errors</li>
</ol>
If errors are found:
<ol start="5">
<li> correct the errors in the WP editor</li>
</ol>
OR
<ol start="5">
<li> correct the errors in the source</li>
<li> repeat steps 2 through 4 again</li>
</ol>
So, in my new process, I've eliminated a couple of steps, but
  I still have to copy/paste my clean WP source into the WordPress
  editor. I addition, I have not taken advantage of the various APIs
  to do the heavy lifting.
<h3>Summary</h3>
  This year has seen a lot of changes in the Raku community, especially
  with the name change, and not all
  are done yet. One area that still needs work is improving the new Raku
  Advent website. We also hope to make it easier to create and post
  Raku Advent articles as well as get more participation. Note the
  2020 schedule is <a href="https://github.com/Raku/advent/blob/master/raku-advent-2020/schedule">open</a> now, so you can get your slot early and avoid
  last minute shopping, er, Raku Adventing!

  Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all!
